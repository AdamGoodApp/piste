    name "Crochues-Berard Traverse"
    description "From the top of the Floria Drag Lift, ski north for 20 metres and put skins on and skin northwards towards the Col Crochues. After around 250 metres of height gain it is usually necessary to take skins off and bootpack the remaining 50 vertical metres up to the Col. Crampons are generally not required for the bootpack but may be useful in icy conditions. From the Col, make a long descending traverse rightwards, passing under the Aiguilles Crochues west face and the Pointe Alphonse Favre south face to reach a large shoulder at c.2300 metres at the foot of the Pointe Alphonse Favre's west ridge. The latter part of this traverse is exposed so take care and keep concentrating all the way! Once at the shoulder, put skins back on and climb north-east up to the Col de Berard. From here, descend the wonderful Berard valley to the tree line. There are countless variations which can be taken to reach the tree line. Once there, stay right of the river and ski to the hamlet of Le Buet via a good track and the occasional tricky section of tight tree skiing. From Le Buet, take the train back to Les Praz and the Flégère carpark."

    name "Couloir Domenech"
    description "This couloir is hidden deeply up the Miage glacier. It is not often repeated since it's extremely steep and narrow and usually some parts are too dry to be skied. Furthermore, just to the side of this line there is the well known Bonatti couloir which attracts more people. This couloir can be reached by Arp lift. Leaving the lift stay on your right without loosing height to reach the ridge. Here keep traversing on your left until reaching a flat part, where with your skins or walking (10 mins) you will arrive on a flat bowl. Put your skis on and start descending keeping your left. until reaching a small bridge. Put your skins back on and start climbing up right in front of you to enter Miage glacier. In 1 - 1.5 hours you will reach the base of the couloir, where the true fatigue will start! You will have to bootpack the 1000 metre couloir, with the cold north wind coming down from it. In the middle of the couloir there can be a rocky step for which a 30 metre rope can be useful The way back follows the glacial moraine, just follow back your skin track until you reach the bridge. Here continue following the evident road that will bring you to Val Very lifts. The lifts close at 4.30 pm, but you can also keep skiing the road in order to reach the Courmayeur parking area."
